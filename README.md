# Enhancing-Hand-Motor-Rehabilitation-through-BCI-Based-Intervention
A project developing a brain-controlled system for hand rehabilitation in hemiparetic stroke survivors. Using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, it interprets brain signals to control external devices, offering personalized interventions to enhance motor recovery and improve overall well-being.

### Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the project "Enhancing Hand Motor Rehabilitation through BCI-Based Intervention." The project aims to develop a brain-controlled system for hand rehabilitation in hemiparetic stroke survivors, utilizing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology to improve motor recovery and overall well-being.

### Project Description
Hemiparetic stroke is a type of stroke characterized by paralysis or weakness on one side of the body. Hand rehabilitation is crucial for helping survivors regain activities of daily living. This project aims to develop a brain-controlled system for hand rehabilitation, leveraging BCI technology to interpret and respond to brain signals, facilitating precise control over external devices. Rooted in modern neuroscience principles, it offers personalized interventions to enhance recovery and improve overall well-being.

### Introduction
Millions of people worldwide are affected by stroke, which occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to perish. Hemiparetic stroke causes paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, affecting motor functions and daily activities. Traditional rehabilitation methods often do not address the root cause of the paralysis, demanding innovative approaches like BCI technology to enhance motor recovery and improve quality of life.

### Motivation
Addressing Motor Function Decline in Stroke Survivors: Stroke patients often experience functional disability of the motor system, and this project aims to develop a solution for children to boost their motor skills, particularly hand function.
Limitations of Traditional Rehabilitation: Conventional rehabilitation approaches are often broad and may not adequately treat the underlying mechanisms affecting motor deterioration, requiring innovative solutions like BCI technology for effective rehabilitation.
